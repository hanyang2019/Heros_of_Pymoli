## __Findings__
1.	Although male constitutes the majority of the total players (84.03%), on an average basis, female players are more willing to spend money in the game ($4.47 vs $4.07).
2.	The distribution of buying capacity in all players is approximately a normal distribution, which indicates that players of age 15-29 accounts for the majority of purchases in the game. Players of age under 10, 20-24 and 35-39 ($4.54, $4.32 and $4.76 per person) are more likely to purchase items than other players in other age groups.
3.	The item price ranges from $1.00 to $4.99. It seems players tend to buy items of higher prices, since the top 5 popular and the top 5 profitable items are all priced around $4.00.
